![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxMorse/Finite-State-Machine/master/fsm_cover.png "Finite State Machine screenshot")

A finite state machine character controller for Godot.  All code necessary for the machine to function is in the scripts folder.  A TestRoom has been included as well to show the machine's functionality.  Note the above screenshot is from the [playable demo](https://maxmorse.itch.io/finite-state-machine-character-controller-demo) on my itch.io page.  The test room included in this repo is bare bones "programmer art"
